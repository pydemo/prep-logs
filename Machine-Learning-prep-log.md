TensorFlow | Is library for distributed numerical computation using data flow graphs. It makes it possible to train and run very large neural networks efficiently by distributing the computations across potentially thousands of multi-GPU servers. TensorFlow was created at Google and it supports many of their large scale Machine Learning applications. It was open-sourced in November 2015.

“Data Science from Scratch”, by J. Grus.| This book presents the fundamentals of Machine Learning, and implements some of the main algorithms in pure python (from scratch, as the name suggests).
  “Machine Learning, an algorithmic perspective”, by S. Marsland.| A great introduction to Machine Learning, covering a wide range of topics in depth, with code examples in python (also from scratch, but using NumPy).
“Python Machine Learning”, by S. Raschka.| Also a great introduction to Machine Learning, leveraging python open source libraries (Pylearn 2 and Theano).
“Learning From Data”, by Y. Abu-Mostafa,
M. Magdon-Ismail, and H. Lin.| A rather theoretical approach to ML, providing deep insights, in particular on the Bias/Variance tradeoff
